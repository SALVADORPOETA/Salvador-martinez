                    I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI websites. 
                    Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there 
                    is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most 
                    proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, 
                    Javascript, and React, I can also build back-end applications with 
                    Python and Django as you can see in my Github repositories.

                    I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I 
                    believe that being a great developer is not using one specific 
                    language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
