                    I specialize in building front-end UI websites. 
                    Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there 
                    is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most 
                    proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, 
                    Javascript, and React, I can also build desktop applications with 
                    Python and Tkinter as you can see in my Github repositories.
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                    I always use good practices and write the cleanest code possible.
                    I believe in companionship and team work and I am willing to help my 
                    coworkers with anything they need if I can do it. I am autodidact 
                    and self disciplined so I need very little supervision.
